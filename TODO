TODO:

* fix crash when called on a non-existing file
* the system lsbom(1) is implemented in plain-C, add a plain-C version of
  this implementation too
* Right now this repo has only been working on re-implementing the lsbom
  executable itself, but ideally it should re-implement the entire
  Bom.framework from /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks
* lsbom needs to support '--help' and '--version' before we can move to
  gnits strictness with automake; this will require a move to getopt_long()
